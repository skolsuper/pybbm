PyBBM - Django forum solution
=============================

PyBBM is a complete Django forum solution with the following features:

* Avatars
* Custom profiles and support of Custom User Model (since Django 1.5)
* Editable posts
* Pre-moderation
* Custom sanitization
* Anonymous posting
* Subscriptions
* Polls
* ...

All features are based on:

* 95% test code coverage
* Twitter Bootstrap 2 default theme
* Ready to use example projects

The main focus in the development of PyBMM is to build it in a way that allows *easy* integration in existing Django-based sites. This means that PyBMM does not provide features like user registration, password restoring or the user login page. (But the example projects show how to do these tasks ;))
